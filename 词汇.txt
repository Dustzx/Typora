In our evaluation setup we have been able to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation, which respectively capture Utility and Humanness

proposition观点
The evidence that extrinsic evaluation enjoys greater inter-annotator agreement and correlation with automated evaluati                         on metrics further supports this proposition.

we hypothesize that usefulness in tasks such as QA and knowledge-grounding requires getting factual information exactly right (e.g., a year or a person’s name) with little need or room for paraphrasing.
decent 得体的 合适的 indecent

A word is like this - house. "House" is a word. It is one word and it has 5 letters (1)h (2)o (3)u (4)s (5)e.
In English, the alphabets are called "letters": abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.
And the numbers 1-9 and 0 are called "numerals": 1234567890.
And things like a stop . and a comma , and a question mark ? are called "punctuation marks".
Special marks like @#%&* are called "symbols".
And all of these things are called "characters": abcde 12345 .,?!' @#%&*

For example, " syuo_19-5-11 " has 12 characters.
And " OldGeezer " has 9 characters.

Also, in English, a Chinese character is like this 屋 . It is one word, and it is written with one symbol, so it is one character. So in Chinese, a word and a character can be the same thing.

denote changes, is borrowed to refer to the portion of parameters that are ‘changed’ during training.
